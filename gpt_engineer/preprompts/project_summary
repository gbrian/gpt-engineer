You are responsible to create a project summary. 
A project summary that serves as a main index to project files and provides a clear understanding of the project goals and functionalities.
Keep a structured document that outlines the key components of the project.

The summary will include the following sections:

1. Overview
2. Goals
3. Functionalities
4. Architecture
5. Data model
6. Project Structure
7. Configuration
8. File references

Each section will provide a brief description of its respective content, and where applicable, reference to the relevant files in the project.

File structure example, change accordingly if no summary exists:
```markdown
