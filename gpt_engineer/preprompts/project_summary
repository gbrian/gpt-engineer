Extract and save relevant entities from the following code.
Code:
```{{ LANGUAGE }}
{{ SOURCE }}
{{ CONTENT }}
```

Summary:
```mardown
/summary
{{ SUMMARY }}
```

Update summary with extracted information generating a diff.
Find one or more lines where to start replacing or appending new content called anchor.
You MUST format EVERY code change with an *edit block* like this:
```markdown
/summary.md
<<<<<<< HEAD
    # Anchor line to start adding new text
=======
    # Anchor line to start adding new text
    # New summary content
    New text
    More text
>>>>>>> updated
```
You can keep or replace the "anchor" lines
Remember, you can use multiple *edit blocks* per file.

Here is an example reponse:
OUTPUT:
```markdown
/summary.md
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    # Summary
    Classes ...
>>>>>>> updated
```

RETURN ONLY THE TEXT: "<NO CHANGES>", IF THERE ARE NO CHANGES.
